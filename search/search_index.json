She smiles, curling her fingers around warm tea in a porcelain cup, and takes a sip. The gentle hum of the Kvasir 's engines bring joy to her heart as it pushes through space, only a few days from taking on a new crew at Victoria Station and jumping out into Etherspace to continue their mission of exploration. Dr. Daws swivels her chair while taking another sip. \"How does everything look, Kim ?\" she requests. \"The board's clear,\" responds a short girl with wild black curls in the Navigator's seat. \"looks like we're alone.\" \"Great-\" Daws begins, but is quickly cut off. \"Correction, Captain!\" Kim shouts. \"Just got something. More than double our size, cigar-shaped, inbound and moving fast.\" The Captain quickly swivels toward the only other person on the bridge. A thick man, sheathed in heavy steam plate armor, responds while looking at his own viewer. \"Readings look like a Technocracy Cruiser, boss, likely a Cassini,\" Walker Steinfort , the ship's Tactical Officer, reports. \"Well, uh... hail them?\" Daws says, though it almost seems like an obvious order. Kim grins, \"Already done.\" Within moments, a small blue hologram of a highly decorated Void Engineer officer glares at the Kvasir's bridge crew. \"I am Fleet Admiral Kason ,\" the man bellows, \"and I demand-\" The Admiral is suddenly cut off, his holographic image flickering, as the Kvasir lurches to the side. Several bridge screens crack and sparks burst from various places. \"Cap!\" Kim yells, a worried look on her face. \"Something just hit us! Missiles are offline and our hull has taken significant damage.\" \"What?!\" squawks Kason as the hologram stabilizes and begins transmitting again. \"How dare you attack me! You will regret this!\" Carolyn's brow tightens. \"What? Surely you don't think that was us??\" she says, but the communication channel has already been closed. \"We have another Cruiser materializing on our starboard side, Captain, and we're being fired upon by the other. Your orders, Ma'am?\" Steinfort asks. \"Battle stations and evasive action, Walker!\" she answers and the man immediately flips a switch. Red lights, signaling the current combat condition, illuminates the ship and a soft clink can be heard as weapons are released. Within moments, the Kvasir lurches again, this time from Void Engineer weapon impacts. \"Our Voidcast is failing, Carol,\" Kim says, \"if we don't get out of here, like now we might never be able to.\" Doctor Daws sighs, defeated. \"Point her at Earth, Kim. If you can get us back to Victoria Station that'd be ideal, but, frankly, anywhere but here!\" Kim Luna gulps, spins a dial until it reads 0.0, closes her eyes, and slams a large lever on her console as far forward as it will go.","title":"Anywhere but Here"},{"location":"anywhere_but_here/#anywhere-but-here","text":"Doctor Carolyn Daws sits in the captain's chair, overlooking her bridge.
